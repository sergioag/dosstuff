This directory contains the BIOS for the IBM-provided Xebec MFM controller.
There were several versions of this controller:

- (Supported!) Variation #1: this officially supports only the Seagate
  ST-412 drive.
- (Should work) Variation #2: a more integrated version, but otherwise
  identical. Even though this should work the same as #1, I don't have
  it and thus cannot test if it works.
- (Supported!) Variation #3 (also known as "20MB Fixed Disk Drive
  Adapter"): Its BIOS is basically the same except that is does have
  switches to select different drive geometries and also the code has
  been greatly improved.

Since the hardware seems to be the same between all versions, except the
switches, I intend to have a single source code for all of them. I also
plan to include dynamic geometry and a friendly way of performing a
low-level format as is available with other controllers.
